\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Questions}

In this section we enumerate research questions that we would like to 
answer in this report. We forsee at least three important questions
in this report. Namely those are:

(i) What to measure in the enterprise networks? 
By answering this question we attempt to shed the light
on most important characteristics in the network traffic analysis. Be it
latency, throughput, goodput, error and loss rate, availablitity.
(ii) How to measure? 
Here we would like to answer how to perform the network measurements.
For example, how to select ventage point, how to minimize the 
dataset, but still be able to grasp the most important characteristics of
the network. 
(iii) When to measure? This question is also important for a number of reasons.
Selecting correct measurement period and correct duration of the measurements intervals
will have the important impact on the quality of the research outcome.
