\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusion}


We have witnessed the stalled TCP connections (connections that do 
not send the data in both dirctions, but remain in ESTABLISHED state).
We do understand why CGNs drop connections - this is done to leave the chance for  
the SP clients to be able connect to the servers on the Internet, but we 
do  not have a clear understanding of the nature of stale connections, perhaps,
Internet providers are not playing nicely with all the TCP connections
and do something strange with them.
