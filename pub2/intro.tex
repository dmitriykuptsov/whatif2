VPNs are common nowadays, but the Service Provider CGNs are 
not all the time playing nicely with the traffic. For example,
we have observed that TCP connections can enter so called 
{\it stale} state: ACKs do not go through in both directions,
but only one. In this case, the connection remains in 
ESTABLISHED state, but the data does not go through.

To ensure that this is the case, we have collected 12 hours of TCP 
traces and plotted the progress of the sequence numbers in both 
directions.
